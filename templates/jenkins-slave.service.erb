# Note: the jenkins-slave sysconfig/defaults file currently has shell variable
# expansions and conditional logic in it that is incapability with systemd's
# concept of an `EnvironmentFile`.  Thus, the sysconfig has to be sourced by
# the run/wrapper script.  This [sadly] requires that the run script be run as
# root so that it has the effective permission to read this file.
